# Notes

Designed for Plutonium IW5. No compiler required.

[Alternative mapvote mod](https://github.com/DoktorSAS/PlutoniumIW5Mapvote) for those that have compiler.

# Features

* Collection of popular maps
* Supports custom XNET gamemodes (you can edit this to your liking or reimplement default)
* Gamemodes include Infected, TDM, DOM, FFA, SD and hardcore variants

# Installation

1) Copy the `admin` folder inside `.\gamemodes\` to your IW5MP root server directory.

2) Copy the `mapvote.gsc` from the `.\mapvote\` folder into `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\iw5\scripts`

3) Profit!

# Additional Notes

You can edit the footer text by opening `mapvote.gsc` and edit `line 70` to what you want using the correct syntax.

You can also comment out `line 12` and uncommment `line 11` if you wish to return back to default gamemodes and default map inclusions.
